# CPP-Graph2
In this project, a list of departure and arrival cities along with the flight cost is provided as input. A graph with edges is then created and the MST Kruskal Algorithm is performed to create a minimum spanning forest, which finds the cheapest flights to visit all cities. Input is read directly from an input file and 4 sample inputs have been provided.
